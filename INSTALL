------------------------------------------

Like most Lazy perl programmers I use MakeMaker, so try:

bash$ perl Makefile.PL
bash$ make
bash$ make test
bash$ make install

And if you have trouble then e-mail me. (p.s. Don't worry, there aren't any
tests yet)

------------------------------------------

This is the first cut of a Perl based java runner package system.

The system is comprised of a set of modules and scripts in Perl that accept
configurations described in XML regarding the system configuration and
application configuration.

These scripts are used to create scripts for controlling java programs.

These scripts are meant ot be easy to read and create by humans and should
allow scripts to be minimal. This means that default values hould be used
wherever possible and the user should not have to specify values to
correctly run a program.

Additionally it should also be the case that the system configuration script
can fall-back to rational defaults in the abscence of a completely defined
configuration file

---------------------------------------

sj.pl

A simple wrapper script that uses SRC/Java.pm to run an XML based script

SRC/Java.pm

A set of subroutines that provide all the functionality of running scripts,
viewing running process details, stopping processes, restarting processes
etc.

SRC/Java/Config.pm

Deals with the parsing of XML configuration files and creating internal Perl
structures that can be used to create commands to run.

-----------------------------------------

Configuration

The sj system relies on configuration information at the system level and at
the application/script level. Please have a look at Java::SJ::Config for
more information.
